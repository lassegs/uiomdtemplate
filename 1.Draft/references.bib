After considering how educational spaces may be `produced' (to use Lefebvre's term), it draws on narratives of classroom practice to explore three dimensions of educational space \textendash{} material, connected and textual \textendash{} and considers the implications that these, and the relationships between them, may have for the use of networked technologies in education. It concludes by setting an agenda for future research, arguing that more extensive empirical work is needed to explore how these dimensions intersect and the implications this has for pedagogy. The need for such research is seen as particularly pressing given increased calls for transformative pedagogies which demand new ways of interacting within and between educational spaces.},

  abstract = {The contextualized nature of learning with technology is widely acknowledged in research, but there remains a lack of sound social theorization to conceptualize and understand this contextualization. Giddens' structuration theory has been proposed as an appropriate tool for analysing and understanding human interactions with technologies. Drawing on Archer's critique of structuration theory, this paper critically analyses some of its recent uses in relation to e-learning and discusses their explanatory limitations. As an alternative, the paper proposes the use of Archer's morphogenetic approach and illustrates how it overcomes some of the major analytical weaknesses of structuration theory by enabling engagement with the powers of both structure and human agency without conflating them in a process of `mutual constitution'. It suggests that Archer's approach provides central analytical and explanatory significance to the multiple specific social contexts within which any e-learning course exists and the specific social interactions that take place amongst those engaged in it. Although based in e-learning for illustrative purposes, the conclusions drawn from comparison between structuration and morphogenetic approaches have application in the enhanced understanding and theorization of learning situations more generally.},

  abstract = {The term `interactive' appears in two distinct strands of educational research discourse: one concerning pedagogy and the other concerning new technologies in education. As new technology increasingly pervades most classrooms in the UK, it seems likely that it would be fruitful to explore, both theoretically and empirically, links between the concepts of `interactive teaching' and `interactive technology'. Previous reviews of the literature concerning interactive teaching have revealed a variety of ideas which are considered to be involved, with a number of common elements suggesting a scale of interactivity ranging from `authoritative' to `dialogic'. There was a consistent suggestion in the literature that shifting the balance of interaction in classrooms towards the dialogic end of the scale would bring improvements to the learning process and consequently to attainment outcomes. However, current analysis focuses on whole-class teaching, which is only one mode of class organisation. This paper explores the literature on interactivity in group and individual work with ICT, and characterises categories of interactivity for these forms of activity organisation. A framework is presented which relates these categories to those previously devised and to the ways in which teachers and learners orchestrate the features of their classroom environment and interact with \{ICT\} to support action towards learning goals. The paper argues that a shift towards a greater role for learners in orchestrating resources in the classroom will be valuable and concludes that there is potential for \{ICT\} to support more dialogic and synergistic approaches in group and individual activity than is seen at present. It also identifies the potential for using the framework in future research concerning the effects of technological developments on learning in classroom settings.},

@article{Netnography2016,
  title = {Netnography},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {Netnography is online ethnography conducted in a specific manner. It is an interpretive research method that adapts the traditional, in-person participant observation techniques of anthropology to the study of the interactions and experiences that manifest through digital communications (Kozinets 1998). The word "netnography" is a portmanteau combining "network" and "ethnography" and was a particular kind of research process which was developed and named in 1995 by Robert Kozinets during his dissertation research at Queen's University on Star Trek fans. Netnography was originally a consumer research method, but use of the method has spread to a range of other disciplines, including education, library and information sciences, hospitality, tourism, computer science, psychology, sociology, anthropology, geography, urban studies, leisure and game studies, and human sexuality and addiction research.

Netnography is similar to an ethnography in five ways:
It is naturalistic: it seeks to study online social interaction by participating within and observing it;
It is immersive: it involves the researcher as a the key element in data collection and creation;
It is descriptive: it seeks rich contextual portrayals of the lived experience of online social life;
It is multi-method: it can involves a range of other methods, such as interviews, semiotic visual analysis, and data science; and
It is adaptable: it can be used to study many types of online sites and technology-related communications and interactions
Netnography aims at a meaning-focused cultural understanding. Use of the term implies the ethnographic collection and interpretation of publicly-available, interactive digital communications as the main source of research data. However, depending upon need, researcher skills, and topical focus, netnographies can also extend to include a range of other data collection and analysis methods including content analysis, semiotic visual analysis, interviews (online and in person), social network analysis and the use of big data analytic tools and techniques (Kozinets 2015). Regardless of which particular data collection and analysis methods are used, the sine qua non of a netnography is the active search for a cultural understanding of interactive online communications and information.
Although earlier versions of netnography emphasized the link to online communities or virtual communities (e.g., Kozinets 1997, 1998), terms that were prevalent in earlier days of Internet research, contemporary netnography emphasizes that a focus on the study of online interaction and experience (Kozinets 2015). Miguel del Fresno writes about netnography as online communities consumption unrelated but online sociability based on the exchange of information (del Fresno, 2011). Whatever the particular orientation, netnography is invariably focused on cultural understanding and insight.},
