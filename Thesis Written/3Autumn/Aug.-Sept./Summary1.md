How is Education Technology translated into Norwegian Education Systems?

How is data protection translated into learning analytics? This is a translation of ontologies of information managment practices..

How does Learning Management Systems (LMS) perform as 'experimental systems' in the technopedagogic organization of national information infrastructures in a secondary educational institution? 

How does the position of the teacher change in relation to the cognitive technologies of the mobile-learning paradigm.
How is the separation between Education Technology and the human mediated for in (post-human perspectives on) the digitalization of schooling, or how separation is performed between computer and human? How to understand code both as genre and technology, as agecement?  In light of Foucauldian theory one could ask how the relationship between the biopolitics and bioeconomics of learning is re-scribed the practice of education. 


Introduction:

I wanted to study the most confusing, pressing and at the same time simple, question that I had encounted working in the field of education. What was the relationship between the LMS and school practice. It seemed overwhelmingly simple, as very little had actually been said about the use of LMS.. however in the background lay questions about the integration of digital methods in classroom life. 

I developed an initial hyphothesis about the relationship between imagined autonomy (informed body) and the position of the 'educational' platform in the organization of content

It was a strategy of seeing online phenomena in offline setting. Which meant to go beyond Suchmans earlier studies of studying questions of digital design in a offline environment or seeing a knowledge management system in action from the inside.


(18.9.17)How do we understand the classroom (in a flank move: both metaphors IN and ABOUT) as organizational technological environment. 
-intersubjective and interactive
-How can we understand codes both as genres and technologies?
>The separation is performed: as a genre (disposition) it helps organize (goals), but as a technology it helps produce (results)

How do we understand theoreitcal frameworks that the classroom enforces?
-The field of Law is associated with an (1st generation) institutional approach (who performs what function)
> it does not ask where goals comes from



Ch.1 Being with teachers (that are) being with student(s).

Like Bruno Latour I tried to set myself up at a desk in the offices of the community that I hoped to study. In 'Laboratory Life' Latour spends two years working next to scientists at a laboratory of biology. I had set off two weeks over the period of two months. The days were much calmer and more relaxing than I remembered working there. Getting into the pace of working as a full-time teacher had been a exhausting experinece, so spending time oberserving the rythms of life as a onviewer was great to gain a different perspective on work. 

Being present was completely necessary to be able to observe life. I struggled alot with catching different persons at availbile moments. Making plans of specific subjects therefore fell into the background..

It had been relatively easy gaining access to the hybrid communities of teacher and finding opportunities for talking about the emergence of standards of conduct. I was both an insider an outsider... gaining an status of independence as a researcher, but also very much being a student myself. 

I could sit with a coffee in hand and join in on conversations about the market for teachers with different qualifications, representations of students and student behavior among the teachers in various situaitons and discussions of right and wrong, or not least discuss the impact of technology on different aspects of school life. 

I had also been able to gain access to education fairs of the kind where providors of education technologies were hording together to attract the attention of school leaders, teachers and administration, bureaucrats and policy makers, and (probably) education researchers like myself. From the moment one entered that hall one met with the presence of strategic leaders.

How was these technologies however translated into the organization? And how have they been effected by the resent change that was happening in the systems within Bergnes?

I wanted to study the influence of market devices and science on the imaginations of affordence. In the same way that the affordance article discuss how research performs understandings of performance, how are these strategies transfered into the management strategies that was part of the organizational setting? Or how code accompany new educational technology as genres of 'text'.



In Fenwick's book ANT in educational research an educational technology is valued differently depending on its relationship with the organization, yet in a landscape filled with different 'genres' of technologies such processes are dynamic and ongoing. How are their value accounted for; in the leadership (org. of resources), in the professional accountability, and in technical interoperability.

Other technologies are enmeshed in networks that exist in paralell to these decentralized technologies, like the SMART-board. They are procured on a product by product basis and everyone could download the program that was associated with the technology on the SMART website. They are not attached to the organization, but depended on a clear contractual relationship with the providor and represented values attached to the 'local' administration.

On the other hand, I had to go through IT-supervisor Alex to get access to the Windows 365 system. The cloud is virtual, so I look at the way it its categorizations values differently. How does it value the PLE as a computer based system through the process of individualization? How does it interest in the digital? Other genres of technologies are associated with the 'public' rights and projects of individualization. This form of controll was linked with the working of the 'offices' and the role of the official school inspectors.

*There was a double separation and sense of autonomy. There was that between the teacher offices and the classroom, and it was between the teacher office and the administrative offices.

Observing these infrastructures are both hard to observe and to know. They are often technical issues. But my provocation lead me to question the separation between the two office spaces and the publics outside. This public space in the hallways was the space in which operated under a shared supervision, and in which was not technical. They were spaces for play and creativity. In fact they displayed many facts about the PLE at the school. So I saw that the PLE was clearly not only part of the online environment. It was filled with a sense of tradition that had been realtively hidden to me when I worked as a teacher. Instead it was the arts teacher and the inspector that I found together in the hallway discussing the history of the school building, the imobile. 

The inspector was concerned with its own tradition, active telling stories of the reforms of education and the philosophy of curriculums (instructional materials). Missing this seperate community and practrice means treating technology as 'socially deterministic'.
She was responsible for inspecting the caretaking for the disabled, but she was concerned with matters of play (and the misunderstood role of punishment). 

'Technology', and that which I was trying to observe as communicative, was reserved for the classrooms (genres like the 'book'). Yet, the technologies was not installed in an architecture reflecting individual-personal learning environement. They were installed in every room. 
The virtual happens between rooms, as matter of simulataneity, in which persons gains rights to being in different rooms. 
Teachers on the other hand are reserved to more or less one room at a time.

*seeing eFl as disability rather than ability.. what needs to be approved..



Coming too the school I had a two-fold strategy. I would study the online phenomenon of the PLE in relation to the offline phenomenon of the evaluation *for* learning scheme. 

Neither phenomenon was in fact completely online or offline. On the contrary, fell further into the opposite chategory.

I started asking about metaphors; both what effect does the PLE metaphor have on the management systems in the classroom, and what effect the EFL (process oriented) metaphor about education had on teacher-student relations


**The online Personal Learning Environment**

*Makes sense when one thinks about the extent to which one is online in the environment of the classroom, except it isn't very personal.

The PLE was a series of systems which I had to move around the school to observe, and to find individuals that had the know how to talk about them. 

The former system had been the basis of a transfer from the old the former Microsoft Learning Gateway (MLG). Everything on the former platform had been folded into a single folder, kept in case it would come to use

In Star and Suchman I had read of the benefits of finding the genitor, and I was hoping to follow him around as he cared for infrastructure. Off course, this infrastructure was not a set of wires or machines plugged together in a virtual world called the PLE. Unlike Sørensens experimental setting of the computer laberatory learning technologies were now mobile. Meaning they were simultaneously enmeshed in a plura of 'new' educational infrastructures - like those of digital text books, SMART-boards, accounting systems, and personal computing devices belonging to the organization and persons (like the smart-phone) - and at the same time autonomous and independently organized by the student. I never saw the ganitor handle any of the computers, although I knew he was responsible for other digital systems pertaining to the fascilities, like the locking systems etc. 

A separation existed between the office infrastructure in the part of the organization that I had gained entrance too and those areas of the organization that performed maintenance on permenantly instaled interactive technologies of the digital school space.

Furthermore, I found out that the IT person had moved away from the office spaces in which the teachers were located. The role had been a hybrid in which the person was sometimes bombarded with questions, of where to look and what to do when staff were failing at routine tasks. The role had been essential in the integration of high-tech solutions in the organization.
The local IT-responsible had re-located to an empty group room, one of the many rooms attached to the classrooms and not the office. It was therefore a great deal harder to gain access there than I had hoped. When I did I heard stories about computers and their maintenance. One story included a student who was considered a troubled individual, but who had a good understanding of computers, and who had been helping with some of the maintenance work. Alex, the IT person, didn't know anything much about the transfer of the earlier LMS, nor did he know much about the installation of the new 3D-projector. 

The permanent nature of installed base meant that although I had not been asking too many questions about the nature of these technologies in the organization of the digital platform we were using. My questions had been directed the other way, towards the relevance of these technologies in my teaching. However, very little attention had been directed towards the infrastructures shared by the students and these systems.... 

The PLE was not simply an installed infrastructure of rooms and organizational sections. To oberserve the so-called PLE venturing out into the organization of the classroom and even the hallways.


**Observing the classroom**



(Sun.17.9.17)
I take care of pupuls and in that way the kids are being 'kept' (Christie). They are forced and a situation follows according to standards of genre (they can i.e. resist the good student). However, I also take care of 'being with' students that being taken care off by others. Mutually we take care of an 'observed' individualism. Our 'being with' is both questioned and negotiated, between us and between us and the pupil-students. 

The subject is not at once a topic under consideration. I come to this topic with concerns related to the way I am being with pupil-students when they are now thaught by me. When they are students, conserned with the tasks they are given independently of me. 

Two themes emerge. One in which they are subject, or forced, to be with me and the other teachers, and one in which they are forced to be working with their studies. In a very real sense, they do not have to work with these studies when they are with the tutor (studies show they often don't). In another sense they don't have to be with any tutor when they are working with their studies. These are two different forms of enforcement and capture - or presence if you like. 

There are however also more forms, and the two above mentioned are intermixed in subjects. Good teachers intermix them well. And sometimes, being with pupil-students the experience of being with learning materials are discussed. The idea that the teacher is also sometimes part of the materiality of learning is discussed in relation to 'forms of communication'.


**Redusing complexity**
-the separations of tasks emerged together with failures in systems that lead to treason among staff..

**The production of an evaluation scheme**
What does it mean to hide the social in the course of the process off.. ? 
Presenting the idea of a few individuals 'testing' and re-establishing trust among teachers towards online channels of communication.
